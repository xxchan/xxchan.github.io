This Week in RisingWave is now migrated to a new dedicated site: [this-week-in-risingwave.vercel.app](https://this-week-in-risingwave.vercel.app).

By the way, xxchan's blog also has a new domain name: [xxchan.me](https://xxchan.me). The old domain name [xxchan.github.io](https://xxchan.github.io) should still work.

Please tell me if any of the links or other things like RSS are broken! Thanks! ðŸ¥°
