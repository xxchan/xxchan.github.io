# Astro Site Test Plan

## Scope & Principles
- Validate the production deployment at `https://xxchan.me/` after the Jekyll â†’ Astro migration. Use the live site unless a staging URL is provided.
- **Do not modify site content or configuration during testing.** All checks must be read-only (browser, curl, Lighthouse, etc.).
- Capture every deviation or regression in the *Findings Log* section below as you discover it. Include URL, observed behaviour, expected behaviour, and current status.

## Preparation Checklist
- Confirm you can reach `https://xxchan.me/` and `https://xxchan.github.io/` over HTTPS.
- Install/update tooling: Chrome (desktop + DevTools), Safari (mobile or device simulator), Firefox, `curl`, and Lighthouse CLI or the Chrome extension.
- Ensure local repo is clean; run `npm install` once to have scripts available for reference (`npm run dev`, `npm run test`), but do not start the dev server unless verifying a fix.

## Test Execution Steps
1. **Baseline Smoke (no edits)**  
   - Load `/` and verify header navigation, hero copy, latest posts list, footer year.  
   - Visit `/404` to confirm custom not-found experience.
2. **Content Parity & Rendering**  
   - Sample three posts (e.g. `2022-02-07-paxos-hard`, `2025-09-28-tool-eval`, a bilingual entry). Check title, dates, TOC presence, KaTeX rendering, code blocks, alternate-language link, tag list.  
   - Validate `/tags/` taxonomy counts and `/tags/<slug>/` listings match expectations from legacy site.
3. **Feeds & Metadata**  
   - `curl -I https://xxchan.me/rss.xml`, `index.xml`, `posts.json` to ensure 200 responses and correct `Content-Type`.  
   - Inspect page source for `<link rel="canonical">`, OG/Twitter tags, and favicon links.
4. **Redirects & Legacy URLs**  
   - Using `curl -I`, test examples from `tests/redirects.test.ts` (`/ai/2025/09/28/tool-eval.html`, `/categories/`, `/cs/2020/09/02/intern-at-meituan.html`) and confirm 3xx status with the desired destination.
5. **Responsive & Accessibility**  
   - In Chrome DevTools, emulate iPhone 14 Pro and a 4K desktop: check navigation wrap, typography, TOC stickiness, table overflow.  
   - Run Lighthouse (or axe) for Accessibility; note all scores < 90 or violations.
6. **Performance & Caching**  
   - Record Performance trace on first load and repeat load; capture TTFB, CLS, asset waterfall.  
   - Verify `Cache-Control` headers for HTML vs. static assets and presence of Brotli/Gzip.
7. **Regression Safety Net**  
   - Run `npm run test` locally (no code changes) to ensure Vitest redirects suite remains green.

## Findings Log
- Use the template below for each issue and append entries in chronological order. Update status as items get triaged or resolved.
